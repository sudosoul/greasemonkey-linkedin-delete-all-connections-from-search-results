# greasemonkey-linkedin-delete-all-connections-from-search-results
This Greasemonkey script, when enabled, will delete all the current connections shown on a search results page. Useful if you want to remove all connections from SomeEvilCompany. Just go to connections, and filter by the company, activate the greasemonkey script, and then keep refreshing. Every time you refresh the page, it removes all those users as your connection. Some manual set up required.
